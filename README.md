=========================

My github.io site:
[aaronbloomfield.github.io](http://aaronbloomfield.github.io)

The utilities in this repo are used to update the site.  This repo has
three submodules, and when each one receives a push, a webhook is
called (git-to-github-io.php); that runs the git-to-github-io shell
script, which pulls this repo and all it's submodules, and then
commits any changes.  This forces a change to the submodules on the
github.io site.
